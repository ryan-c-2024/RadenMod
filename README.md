# RadenMod
A robust C++ mod suite for popular video game Counter-Strike using Win32 API

Raden is a comprehensive .DLL mod written in C++ that heavily leverages the Win32 API for a number of its functions and uses the Valve Source Development Kit SDK. It is design to interface and interact with the popular video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and expand on the game's features.

Raden was written as a summer project and features optimized pointer-level programming and efficient design patterns and object-oriented programming. It includes a graphical menu and user interface accessible from within the game and a robust suite of features. 

Counter-Strike binaries were understood and analyzed using the live Ollydbg debugger and the industry-standard IDA binary disassembler. Following this, systems-level programming techniques were applied to interface with the game's functions and expand on what is normally possible.

RadenMod was formerly independently marketed and sold online but is now going open source for all to enjoy, appreciate, and learn from.
